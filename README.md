# Counting_votes
Task 1â€”

Download the file 2021-09-14_party distribution_1_st_2021.csv Download 2021-09-14_party distribution_1_st_2021.csvto your 

project folder. If you cannot download it here, try downloading it in the Modules section of Canvas. Open it and inspect its

structure. Find out which columns contain 

the district name (Fylkenavn)

party code (Partikode)

number of votes received (Antall stemmer totalt)

Write a program that

reads the file and counts the total number of votes for each party across all districts

prints the results in a table, starting with the party with the largest number of votes

Modify your program so that it also prints the percentage of votes received by each party (2 decimals).

Further extend your program so that it marks the parties that received at least 4% of the vote.

Turn your code into a function that takes the file name and the number of parties to include in the table as arguments. 

Hint: to indent several lines simultaneously, mark them and hit "Tab". Use the function to print the table once with 3 and

once with 7 parties.

Modify the code so that giving the number of parties to tabulate becomes optional. If the user calls the function with just

the filename, all parties should be included in the table.
